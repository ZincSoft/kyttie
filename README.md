# Kyttie
Kyttie is the Catnet reference implemention. More information will be added here... in the future!

## Building
To build kyttie, simply run the Makefile. Things should be autodetected or the defaults should be
sane. Look through the Makefiles if you don't trust a bunch of highschools to not fuck your
computer to high hell.

```
make
```

Set the `KDIR` environment variable to build against a custom kernel, which is recommended if you
choose to develop, but if that was your intent you probably already knew that.

It's not automatically installed, you have to do that yourself :)

## Kernel Version
Kyttie is actively developed against 6.1.0-rc3, but it's based off some really stagnant kernel APIs
so it should work fine.

## Examples
Don't let the examples directory fool you, that's internal testing stuff.
